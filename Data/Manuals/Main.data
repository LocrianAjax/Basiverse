:Introduction

Welcome to Basiverse! 

This is a little game that I've been kicking around for a long time, but could never commit to finishing. This is the most "Complete" version of the game I've ever made.

I've worked on this 100% by myself(Even this Manual system), with the only package I'm using is Spectre Console to make the menu creation easier.

As a result, there's some jankiness and buginess in the game that I'm still working on. If you find a bug, let me know please! 

The next few pages go over the basics of the game and it's little mini-games, have fun!
\
:Basics

In the main game menu you'll find a overview of the system you're in on the far left of the screen, it's name and any points of interest (POIs) it contains.

In the middle of the screen you'll find information on your ship, shield strength, hull strength, and heat.

On the right of the screen you'll find information on systems withing your jump range, names and brief description of what they might contain.

Below that display is the main action menu. Here you'll find option that vary based on what's in the area. 

Additionally you can save, quit, and get detailed information on your ship, incuding your cargo!

Be careful jumping around wildly, there are bandits around and you could be attacked at any time.........
\
:Combat

You win combat by not dying, dying is game over. 

The combat display is similar to the main game display, but with some combat specific information.

You have a handful of main actions in the combat menu.

You can fire lasers, that create heat but are garunteed to do damage.

You can fire missiles, that deal more damage than lasers, but might miss and have limited stock.

You can activate your heatsink, giving a temporary bonus to heat dissipation.

Additionally you can eject a heat core, a limited use action that completely clears your heat.

If your shields are offline, you can reactivate them giving you 20% capacity back.

You can also overload your shield at the cost of adding heat to the hull.

Finally you can attempt to flee. 

Your opponent has the exact same options as you do, but some enemies behave differently than others. Be wary of trying to memorize attack patterns.
\ 
:Docking

When you go to dock at a station, you need to manually adjust the ship to point properly at the station.

You have 50u of fuel to make it happen, so be careful! If you fail to dock you'll have to go around and try again.

At the top left of the screen, you'll have a display of your remaining fuel and your relative speed.
\
:Mining

Some Systems have mineable asteroids in them, by tuning your combat lasers to the right frequencies you can clumsily rip some ores out of the asteroid!

You'll be presented with a array of Asteroid locations, with your selection in green. By pressing the spacebar you can pulse your laser at the location, possibly revealing some nice loot!

In the top left of the screen, you'll find the asteroid's remaining health.
